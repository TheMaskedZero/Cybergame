# Cybergame

## Overview of the Game:
My project is a small open world shooter with abilities and a cyberpunk aesthetic. The player can switch between a pistol and a sword, while also being able to use abilities, such as throwing a javelin. So far there is only one room you can enter. At the moment there currently isn’t any quests or an end goal.

### The main parts of the game:
Player - The player is controlled with both keyboard inputs through WASD and mouse to control where you look. You can also press Space to jump.

Enemies - They move towards the player and can be killed by either being shot, slashed by the sword or hit by the javelin.

Play area - The area you play on is an open field, where the player can move freely around. There are some buildings that the player can go around, and a room they can enter. There isn’t a border on the edge so the player can walk off if they want.

### Game features:
You can swap between two weapons, a gun and a sword, which also switches the UI.

You can use an ability to throw a javelin.

You can kill enemies.
